# 📘 Day 1 – Introduction to Hardware & Basic Troubleshooting

### 🖥️ Overview of Computer Components

- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** Executes instructions, performs calculations. Key features: cores, clock speed, cache.
- **RAM (Random Access Memory):** Temporary volatile memory for fast access. Types: DDR3, DDR4, DDR5.
- **Motherboard:** Mainboard connecting CPU, RAM, chipset, BIOS/UEFI, and peripherals.
- **Storage Devices:** HDD (slower, cheaper), SSD (faster, reliable), NVMe SSD (very high speed).
- **PSU (Power Supply Unit):** Converts AC to DC, provides power to all components.
- **Peripherals:** Input (keyboard, mouse) and output (monitor, printer).

### 🔧 Hands-on Practice

- Safe handling: anti-static precautions, unplugging before work.
- Assembly/disassembly of CPU, RAM, PSU, and storage devices.

### ⚠️ Common Hardware Issues

- Loose connections, faulty RAM, overheating, PSU failure, display not detected.

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting Tools

- **POST (Power-On Self-Test):** Diagnostic beep codes.
- **Multimeter:** Check PSU voltage, continuity.
- Stepwise diagnosis: PSU → RAM → storage → replacement.

### ✅ Key Takeaways

Understanding the interdependence of components and practicing safe troubleshooting is essential for IT roles.
