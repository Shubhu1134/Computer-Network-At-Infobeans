## üñ•Ô∏è 1. Overview of Computer Components

Understanding the building blocks of a computer system:

- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** Known as the 'brain' of the computer. Executes instructions and performs calculations.  
  _Key features:_ clock speed (GHz), cores, threads, cache memory.

- **RAM (Random Access Memory):** Temporary storage used by the CPU for fast data access. Volatile memory (data is lost when powered off).  
  _Types:_ DDR3, DDR4, DDR5.

- **Motherboard:** The main circuit board that connects all components. Houses CPU socket, RAM slots, chipset, expansion slots, BIOS/UEFI firmware.

- **Storage Devices:**

  - HDD (magnetic, cheaper, slower)
  - SSD (flash-based, faster, reliable)
  - NVMe SSD (next-gen, very high speed using PCIe lanes)

- **Power Supply Unit (PSU):** Converts AC power to DC power. Different wattages based on system requirements.

- **Peripherals:** Input devices (Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner). Output devices (Monitor, Printer, Speakers).

## üîß 2. Hands-on: Hardware Assembly & Disassembly

- **Safe handling:** Use anti-static precautions (ESD wrist strap, grounding). Always unplug before working.
- **Steps practiced:** Installing/removing RAM, mounting CPU and thermal paste, connecting PSU, installing storage, closing case.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Common Hardware Issues

- Loose connections ‚Äì cause of no boot or device not detected.
- Faulty RAM ‚Äì frequent crashes, blue screens.
- Overheating ‚Äì system slowdown, shutdown, or damage.
- Power issues ‚Äì PSU failure, faulty cables, incorrect wattage.
- Peripheral issues ‚Äì keyboard/mouse not responsive, display not working.

## üõ†Ô∏è 4. Troubleshooting Techniques & Tools

- **POST (Power-On Self-Test):** Runs basic diagnostics. Errors shown via beep codes.
- **Multimeter:** Checks voltages, detects shorts.
- **Stepwise diagnosis:**
  1. Check PSU and connections.
  2. Inspect and reseat RAM.
  3. Check storage device connections.
  4. Replace faulty components if necessary.

## üí° 5. Key Takeaways

- Computer = Interdependent components.
- Troubleshooting = Theory + Hands-on.
- Small issues (dust, cables, heat) can cause big failures.
- Tools like multimeter and diagnostics simplify repair.
